                  This project utilizes the power of the serverless services out
                  there in the wild.

              So I came across this amazing book on Serverless Architectures on
              AWS With examples using AWS Lambda by Peter Sbarski which is a
              whole project in the form of a book that explains almost
              everything from the basics to building and fairly complex
              architecture to host the whole video hosting website.
              <br /><br />
              Even if you have not come across the serverless services like AWS
              Lambda, API Gateway, S3 buckets, SNS (Simple Notification
              Service).
              <br /><br />
              A must-read if you are a beginner and could not find a way where
              to start.
              <br /><br />
              What is a lambda function?
              <br /><br />
              <i>
                “AWS Lambda is a compute service that executes code written in
                JavaScript (node.js), Python, C#, or Java on AWS infrastructure.
                Source code (JARs or DLLs in case of Java or C#) is zipped up
                and deployed to an isolated container that has an allocation of
                memory, disk space, and CPU.</i
              >
              <br /><br />
              <i>
                The combination of code, configuration, and dependencies is
                typically referred to as a Lambda function . The Lambda runtime
                can invoke a function multiple times in parallel. Lambda
                supports push and pull event models of operation and integrates
                with a large number of AWS services.''
              </i>
              <br /><br />

              Boring isn't it
              <br /><br />
              Let's explain it with an example
              <br /><br />
              Most of this software requires servers running in data centers or
              in the cloud that needs to be managed, maintained, patched, and
              backed up. Provisioning, managing, and patching of servers is a
              time-consuming task that often requires dedicated operations
              people.
              <br /><br />
              Imagine a world where you can skip all those.
              <br /><br />
              Yes, it is possible through the Lambda function. It's a compute
              service from Amazon web services that can execute code in a
              massively parallelized way in response to the events. Lambda takes
              your code run it without any need to provision servers, install
              software, deploy containers, or worry about the low- level
              details.
              <br /><br />
              Still don't doesn't make any sense, don't worry you will once you
              start building it by yourself.
              <br /><br />
              You just have to start it without thinking too much.
              <br /><br />
              So, let us begin with the first module.
              <br /><br /><br />
              Services used:
              <br />
              <ol>
                <li>AWS Lambda - to run your code</li>
                <br />
                <li>Amazon S3 - to store your video files</li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  AWS transcoder - convert the videos in appropriate formats
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Simple Notification Service (SNS) - to trigger other services
                  or send the notification through e-mail and text message.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              <br /><br />
              Every Video hosting site has a video transcoder that converts the
              video to be able to watch on multiple devices.
              <br /><br />
              S3 bucket is used for storing the uploaded videos and it will be
              integrated with Lambda to trigger the Elastic transcode whose sole
              purpose is to create the video in a different format like 360p,
              720p, 1080p.
              <br /><br />
              <a href="#" class="image featured"
                ><img src="Videohost_files/image001.png" alt=""
              /></a>
              <ol>
                <li>User-uploaded data went to S3 object Storage.</li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  As soon as the video is uploaded it triggers the Lambda
                  function as configured in the event section in the S3
                  properties.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Lambda function now creates a transcode code job for Elastic
                  transcoder by providing the pipeline ID, file location, and
                  format type we need to have as an output
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  The job will then be submitted to the Elastic Transcoder for
                  processing
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  The submitted job is then executed by the Elastic Transcoder
                  and generate the 3-video format
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  These newly created video formats were then saved in another
                  S3 bucket.
                </li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <a href="#" class="image featured"
                  ><img src="Videohost_files/image003.png" alt=""
                /></a>
                <li>
                  Now we have all the format (320p,720p,1080p) in new S3 bucket
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Just like we have event configured in the upload s3 bucket
                  which triggers the lambda function for the transcoder job,
                  this time we trigger the SNS service for notification.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  An SNS service was configured to send notification and to act
                  as the event for the Lambda function.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Once the SNS was triggered it does two things</li>
                <br />
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    Change the object permission (so that it can be accessed
                    within the application)
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>Create the metadata of the generated format.</li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                    Also, send the notification to the user with the metadata of
                    the upload file.
                  </li>
                  <br />
                </ol>
                <li>
                  a. This lambda function will change Object (video file)
                  permission generated by the Elastic transcoder
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  b. This lambda function will create the metadata file within
                  the same S3 bucket where the formatted files are created.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              <br /><br />
              <b>Second module:</b>
              <br />
              Adding authentication to the website which allows user to login in
              and browses through the personalized content, by personalized I
              meant the user's uploaded content.
              <br /><br />
              Services used:
              <br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li>AWS Lambda</li>
                <br />
                <li>API Gateway</li>
                <br />
                <li>Auth0 for user authentication</li>
                <br />
                <li>AWS IAM for user authorization</li>
                <br />
                <li>Website (FE) using Bootstrap and jQuery.</li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              <br />
              The below Figure will explain how the Auth0 was integrated with
              the website to authenticate the user and then the JWT token
              returned from the Auth0 were used to authorize the user to access
              the back AWS services.
              <br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li>Users click the login button on the website.</li>
                <br />
                <li>The client application launches the Auth0 login screen.</li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  For now, the only social provider you can use free on Auth0 is
                  Google-oauth2
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Authentication is performed through Auth0 and once it
                  authenticates by the social provider Auth0 sends JSON Web
                  Token which later then be exchanged to access backend services
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Once the user is authenticated client application requests the
                  API Gateway
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  API Gateway passes the received JWT token to the lambda
                  function.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  Lambda function validates the JWT token and generates a
                  response sends back to API Gateway and eventually reaches the
                  client application.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
              <a href="#" class="image featured"
                ><img src="Videohost_files/image005.png" alt=""
              /></a>
              <b>Third module:</b>
              <br />
              Since we are transcoding the video in appropriate formats, the
              transcoder needs some time to build those formats
              <br /><br />
              This module is for adding the buffer time, so that once the user
              upload video completes frontend show animation which denotes the
              uploaded video in under transcodeing phase this is done by
              maintaining an entry in the Google Firebase database which mark
              the video transcoding : True for video under this phase
              <br /><br />
              The final architecture looks like this.
              <br />
              <a href="#" class="image featured"
                ><img src="Videohost_files/image007.png" alt=""
              /></a>
              As the video is sent to the transcoder, we will make an entry to
              the firebase database will make entry to its database by setting
              its transcoding value to true.
              <a href="#" class="image featured"
                ><img src="Videohost_files/image009.png" alt=""
              /></a>
              And the lambda function which gets the list of all transcoded
              videos from the S3 bucket is designed to pick only those videos
              whose transcoding value is false.
              <br /><br />
              During the course through this book, you will create several
              lambda functions which will get minor updates now and then as you
              move through the different chapters.
              <br /><br />

              There were other parts to the projects which I skipped so that I
              would not overwhelm you guys
              <br /><br />
              For the beginners, I know for start, it seems too much to take on,
              but believe me, all the parts of the chapters were designed to
              build the smallest module first and building it pieces by pieces
              to the final big module.
              <br /><br />
              All the integration parts where different functions and API
              gateways integrated were explained alongside to keep the rhythm.
              <br /><br />
              If you are interested to explore the world of serverless you would
              love it.

                Hi this is Ruben Rao. Its my first attempt to develop any
                project completely on the serverless services. This website
                demonstrates all my project behind the scenes, that I've
                completed to explore and learn serverless services
