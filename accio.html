                The current project that I handle in my current organization
                facilitates the fintech companies to communicate with the
                banking services like checking the account balances, making
                payments, creating standing orders for OTT subscriptions, etc.
                <br /><br />
                One of the roles we have as apart from usual backend stuff is to
                analyze and resolve the queries from our financial service
                provider.
                <br /><br />
                Analyses and finding that we require to find the cause of a real
                problem need us to follow specific steps:
                <br />
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Find the unique request-id, usually the starting point of our
                  investigation and provided by the FinTech provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check the application health at the time the request reaches
                  our application from the FinTech provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Find and analyze the whole request lifecycle, which varies
                  from the type of transaction the user performed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Search the application log file to find any failures or
                  rejections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Investigating the actual request and response made from the
                  API.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <br />
              The above process is too manual, and it's not ideal if we need to
              check the multiple requests at the same time. This whole manual
              process fuels my inner lazy guy to either ignore it or do
              something about it, and for the latter choice, I've to build
              something which removes all manual tasks, making the lazy guy
              happy.
              <br /><br />

              And to get details from the database, we have to perform specific
              operations for every request in our queue for analyses.
              <br /><br />

              Next section we will explore more about the architecture of the
              Web, Facebook, and SMS chat boot.
              <br /><br />

              <ol>
                <li>Log in to the database.</li>
                <li>
                  Query the database table which stores all the events(lifecycle
                  of request) of a particular request.
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      For every individual request, we have multiple events
                      triggered to complete its lifecycle, and each such request
                      has its own entry or row inside the database table; let's
                      call this table LOG_TABLE.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For analyzing any request, we have to check all the event
                      req/res data to find the possible cause for a failure.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If we have to check any event, we need to copy the BLOB field
                  of that event from the LOG_TABLE and then paste it to the IDE
                  or notepad++.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then we have to re-format the JSON req/res because it wasn't
                  in a readable format when we copied it from the LOG_TABLE.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br /><br />
              The above process is too manual, and it's not ideal if we need to
              check the multiple requests at the same time. This whole manual
              process fuels my inner lazy guy to either ignore it or do
              something about it, and for the latter choice, I've to build
              something which removes all manual tasks, making the lazy guy
              happy.

              <h3>Designing the Frontend</h3>

              After struggling with data extraction, now I know where to
              start.<br /><br />
              Every request identification number we receive from our source is
              the first piece of information we have to begin with, and for
              that, I need a pleasant and straightforward frontend.
              <br /><br />

              I sketched the layout below and added some extra features that
              would help me identify the problem.<br /><br />
              The design I started with initially changed quite a bit because
              some of the features I wanted to add were more on the gimmicky
              side rather than useful for analysis.
              <br /><br />
              <img
                src="images/accio_file/design-1.png"
                class="image featured"
              />
              And after adding some more features like the table-view to select
              the event and view the event information, my primary purpose of
              creating this application is completed.<br /><br />
              <img
                src="images/accio_file/design-2.png"
                class="image featured"
              />
              <h3>Future Enhancement:</h3>
              I believe there's always room for improvement, and I try to add
              those features regularly if I find something during my analysis of
              a new problem.
              <br /><br />
              The most helpful feature I wanted was to add a layout of the API
              call in a graphical way, which is a visual representation of the
              API's call made for the incoming request. GUI representation of
              the API's flow will help the new employees visualize the whole
              lifecycle of the actual request.
              <br /><br />
              My current plan is to add the status page, which runs the
              predefined queries to extract the stats from the database and
              display them on the main page.
              <br /><br />

              <h3>Final product:</h3>
              Below is a snapshot of the main page and one sample request
              extraction in gif format.
              <br /><br />
